\setDocAbstract{%
Once operational, the \gls{LSST} is bound to become the dominant contributor of Solar System object observations and discoveries.
Millions of asteroids are going to be observed on a regular basis leading to a yield of around two billion \gls{SSO} observations after ten years of operations.
Internal and external services that ingest and process \gls{LSST} data on a regular basis, such as the \gls{IAU} Minor Planet \gls{Center}, 
have a great interest in the predicted data \gls{flux} directed their way. This \gls{DMTN} provides updates on 
LSST \gls{SSO} observation and discovery rates as well as their uncertainties. Estimates on the number and distribution of \gls{SSO} observations that can not be linked to
known or newly discovered objects and may, thus, trigger unwanted alerts are being provided. 
Likely data rates for daily submissions of \gls{SSO} observations to the Minor Planet \gls{Center} are discussed.}
