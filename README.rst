LSST Asteroid Discovery Rates

DMTN-109
--------

Once operational, the LSST is bound to become the dominant contributor of Solar System object (SSO) observations and discoveries.
Millions of asteroids are going to be observed on a regular basis leading to a yield of around two billion SSO observations after ten years of operations.
Internal and external services that ingest and process LSST data on a regular basis, such as the IAU Minor Planet Center, 
have a great interest in the predicted data flux directed their way. This DMTN provides updates on 
LSST SSO observation and discovery rates as well as their uncertainties. Estimates on the number and distribution of SSO observations that can not be linked to
known or newly discovered objects and may, thus, trigger unwanted alerts are being provided. 
Likely data rates for daily submissions of SSO observations to the Minor Planet Center are discussed.
