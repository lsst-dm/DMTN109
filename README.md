LSST discovery estimates for Solar System Objects

## Main Belt Asteroids
LSST discoveries of Solar System Objects will be dominated by Main Belt Asteroids (MBAs). 
The folder "mba" contains a Jupyter notebook (MAF_SSO_MBA_DISCOVERY_2k.ipynb) that quantifies how many MBAs are likely
to be discovered during LSST's baseline2018b observation campaign (http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:8080/). 

The notebook contains the relevant figures and data. 
Samples of the input files are provided.
In order for the notebook to run the LSST stack has to be working.
